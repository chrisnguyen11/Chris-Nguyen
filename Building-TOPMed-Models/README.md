- **01a_EN_baseline.R** - contains all functions to run the Baseline Elastic Net linear regressions. 
- **01b_intermediate.R** - contains all the file paths needed to run the 01a_EN_baseline.R script. Any adjustments needed to run the scripts are most likely to the file paths. 
- **01c_qsub.txt** - run the script using qsub
- **rho_averages.R** - plots the rho averages from the model summaries, requires the used of rho_vsID.txt to get a file that contains all the rho averages. 
    - Refer to [Ashely's script](https://github.com/RyanSchu/TOPMED/blob/master/Proteome/Baseline_Elastic_Net/baseline_rho_avg.R) as it is more complete and easier to use.
